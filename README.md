# Welcome to Class Everyone ðŸ˜€ðŸ‘‹

On Gitlab you'll be able to find all of the code that we'll be reviewing during each of the classes. Before the start of class on Monday, you'll want to `git pull` from this repository.

It's important that if you want to use the files from this project that you copy them to another directory. Each week, when you `git pull` any files that you have changed in this directory will be overwritten.

## Git - Getting Set-up

In the top right corner of this page you should see a button called "Clone". Clicking this button will show a dropdown with two fields one for `ssh` and the other for `https`. You'll need to copy the text from the `https` field. It should look something like this:

```console
https://utoronto.bootcampcontent.com/utoronto-bootcamp/utor-virt-data-pt-04-2021-u-b.git 
```

Make sure to have installed `git` (the installation link is [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)) then open a terminal on your computer. For mac users, search for `terminal`. For windows users, you have several options, but it's recommended that you either use `gitbash` or `powershell` - both are available from your start menu.

After you have your terminal, navigate to your desktop (mac: `cd ~/Desktop`, windows: `dir ~/Desktop`) and run the following command:

```console
clone https://utoronto.bootcampcontent.com/utoronto-bootcamp/utor-virt-data-pt-04-2021-u-b.git 
```

You should now have a new directory on your desktop with this file!

## Additional Resources

As we go through the class the instructional staff will occasionally be sharing additional resources with additional reading or exercises that you can refer to if you want to dig deeper into the material.

Additional resources will be available [**here**](Resources.md)
